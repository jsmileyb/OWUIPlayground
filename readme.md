This repository contains practice Python functions and pipelines for testing OpenWebUI integrations. These are template implementations and testing modules for various services including:

- OpenAI Chat Integration
- Midjourney Image Generation (via GoAPI)
- Wikipedia Pipeline

## Purpose

These modules are designed for:
- Testing OpenWebUI functionality
- Providing template implementations
- Learning and development purposes

## Note

These are practice implementations and should not be used in production without proper security review and error handling.

## Structure

- `owui_openai_chat.py` - OpenAI Chat integration template
- `goapi_midjourney_pipeline_03.py` - Midjourney image generation pipeline
- `wikipedia_pipeline.py` - Wikipedia data fetching pipeline

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies (requirements.txt needed)

3. Set up your environment variables for API keys

## Disclaimer

This is a testing/learning repository. API keys and endpoints in the code should be replaced with your own secure credentials in a production environment.
